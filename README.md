# Challenging-Task-Lost-and-Found-item-tracker-
My Vithyarthi project
Overview of the project
This Lost and Found Item Tracker is a simple application you run on your computer using text commands (a CLI application). It is built using Python to help quickly manage and keep track of things that are lost and found in a school,office etc.
The system is organized into three main parts:
1.	Main App (main_app.py): This runs the menu and takes your commands.
2.	Database Code (database_codes.py): This talks to a MySQL database to save, load, and update all the item information.
3.	Display Code (Non_db-functions.py): This handle’s clearing the screen and making the search results look neat and easy to read.
Main goal was to create one effective and efficient platform where everyone can quickly search for items and see if a lost item has been found.
