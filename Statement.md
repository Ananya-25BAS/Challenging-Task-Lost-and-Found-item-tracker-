Problem statement:In this world many people lose their things or some may find the lost things. But the problem occurs with the next step. What to do with these lost/found items? So here the we’ll need to find the solution. But I have a solution, that is, a lost-and-found item tracker. The lost-and-found item tracker is a necessary platform required for tracking and finding the items which are lost or found. It is necessary because if an item is found/lost we may not know whom these items belong to and it is really difficult to search for the person who lost the item.Implementing this will only bring profit to people. It doesn’t have any negative impacts or security problems, instead it solves the problem effectively and efficiently.
Scope of the project:This project is a simple, focused digital tool for keeping track of lost and found things.
The Main Job---Saving Records: Its primary job is to safely store all the details of items that are lost or found. This information is saved permanently in a MySQL database.Simple Management: You can easily add new lost or found records of items, look them up, and change their status .Searching: It lets you search the database using keywords to see if a lost item matches something that was found.
How You Use---Typing Only (CLI): You interact with the system only by typing commands and numbers on the computer screen.
Target users : The target user is anyone who needs a fast, reliable, and non-graphical way to track who lost what, where, and when.
